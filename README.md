Simultaneously, across the world, everyone hears a voice in their head. 
"In 2 hours, the server will be shutting down for the final time. Thank you for playing Human Â®."

  Suddenly, there was panic everywhere. Nobody knew what to do. People lost their minds as this voice boomed from the sky. 
  "Thank you for playing Human, shut down in 2 hours." 
  It wouldn't stop repeating this as people lost it. Who was behind this, and how were they going to stop it?
  At the same time, people still chanted, "F..k Joe Biden!"
  This helped calm everyone down, as these words were words of power. Was Joe behind this is the question? Probably.
  Find out next time when we come back. Now a word from our sponsor, Raid Shadow Legends.
  
  "Thank you Humans for competing in this weeks brawl. The winnner has received a grand total of 10 million dollars. we would like to thank all of our soldout crowd of 50,000 for watching a group of poverished people off the streats fight for a chance to change their lifes. we are planning on having one more game before the server shuts down. with the biggest reward of a 1,000,000 dollars the winner will be able to live what little life they have remaining lavishly. now who would like to risk their life in a fight to the death battle sign up online!!"  
   
A group of private investigators quickly met up in there old office. "DO WE REALLY HAVE LESS THAN 2 HOURS TO LIVE??" one PI yelled in a panic.
"there must be something we can do?" another PI remarked. The boss tried franticlly to calm the group down but to no prevail. until a dark figure immerged from the corner, "I know who did this. and we can stop this. we do not have to die today!"
